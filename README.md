# BMI-Application

# This project is a BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator built with Streamlit, a popular Python framework for creating web applications. The BMI calculator allows users to input their weight and height and calculate their BMI. The result includes a BMI value and the corresponding risk level (nutritional deficiency, low, moderate, or high risk).

# The BMI result changes colors based on the risk level, making it easy to understand at a glance.
# Includes error messages if there are invalid inputs (e.g., weight & height less than or equal to 0)
